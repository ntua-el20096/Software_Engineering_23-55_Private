# Our very first official Code!

server.js: fully done endpoints 1-8, not populating the database, just uploading to the server temporarily

server_new.js: fully done endpoint 2, populating the database

server_new2.js: fully done endpoints 1-8, populating the database, but some of them don't work (because of the foreign keys). Also, there is a table that needs to be done in the database?? to fit the endpoint 4, namebasics

in all of them, the endpoint number 9 needs update, it's not fully done
