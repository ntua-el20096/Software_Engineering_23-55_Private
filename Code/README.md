# Our very first official Code!

Speicifically, one javascript file that connects to the server and makes it listen to a port. Then it asks a couple HTTP requests such as a simple GET
and it executes a healthcheck (our first endpoint).

It needs some organization in terms of files and routes in order for each of the different operations (database connection, server, HTTP requests) to 
have a separate code file. 
Also, it needs some editing so that our baseURL is changed to the desired one in the instructions.
