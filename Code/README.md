# Server code

server.js: fully done endpoints 1-8, not populating the database, just uploading to the server temporarily

server_new.js: fully done endpoint 2, populating the database

server_new2.js: fully done endpoints 1-9, populating the database, but some of them don't work (because of the foreign keys). 
Title_basics and title_ratings work perfectly, the rest don't work because of the foreign keys.
Also, there is a table that needs to be done in the database?? to fit the endpoint 4, namebasics
